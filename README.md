# graph-search-algorithms
A prototype-framework of some Blind Search Algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Depth Limited Search ) and Informed Search algorithms with applying them on few examples (8 cube, graph coloring).

This is a prototype-framework that has been implemented as an academic project of Advanced Algorithms course.

The Framework is designed in a way that allowed as to implement multiple search algorithms.

It includes some `Blind Search` Algorithms:
* Breadth First Search.
* Depth First Search.  with applying them on few examples (8 cube, graph coloring).
* Depth Limited Search.

And some `Informed Search` Algorithms:
* A-Star Algorithm.

Finally, it includes few problems (toy examples) to run the implemented algorithms on such as:
* 8-cube problem.
* graph coloring problem.
